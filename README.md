# Introduction to Deep Learning in TensorFlow
This is the repository for the Deep Dive: Introduction to Deep Learning in TensorFlow,
organized by [Cornell Data Science](https://cornelldata.science/).   
No prior knowledge in machine learning or Python is assumed, except for simple matrix algebra and
basic understanding of coding.

## Installation 
To download all course material, type the following into the command-line:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CornellDataScience/Deep-Learning-Course.git
``` 
For those with native pip, use the following to install all dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
All material is written in Python 3 (although most code is Python 2-compatible).  
For detailed installation instructions on git, Python, and TensorFlow, see the
[installation](https://github.com/CornellDataScience/Deep-Learning-Course/tree/master/00-TensorFlow-Installation)
section.
