# Installation Instructions

TensorFlow is a software library for Machine Learning developed by Google 
(created in 2015). Although it is primarily used in Python, APIs for C++, Java
(among others) also exist. It gets its name from the fact that a *tensor* is 
a multi-dimensional array (the *n*-dimensional generalization of a matrix)!  
  
If you have experience installing Python packages, simply follow the official
TensorFlow instructions [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).

## Installing Python

The recommended way to install Python is through Anaconda, 
which conveniently installs Python and many packages that are
commonly used in data science. 

1. Go to the Anaconda [website](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
and Download the Python 3.6 version for your operating system.

2. Find the downloaded files (probably in your Downloads folder)
    
**Mac**: Double click the `.pkg` file  
**Windows**: Double click the `.exe` file  
**Linux**: In the terminal, run `bash Anaconda*.sh`
    
Follow the prompts on the installation screen/terminal prompt.
**If at any time you are unsure about settings, just accept the
defaults (these can always be changed later).**  
Depending on your operating system, you should see something
similar to one of the following:

3. (Optional) Test your installation
    
**Mac/Linux**: Open a terminal and run `conda list`  
**Windows**: Open the Anaconda Prompt and run `conda list`
  
If a list of installed packages appears (or anything other
than an error), you are good to go!  
  
## Installing Git

Git is a version control system - GitHub is a website that hosts
version control services, and it is where we keep all course material.

**Mac**:   
* To find out if you already have git installed, open
a terminal and type `git -- version`. If you see `git version x.x`,
then you already have git.  
1. If you do not already have git, download the latest 
[Git for Mac installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/)
and follow the installation prompts.   
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/CornellDataScience/Deep-Learning-Course.git`
to download all course material.  
 When complete, run the clone command given above.
  
**Windows**:  
* To find out if you already have git installed, open a command prompt
(by going to `Windows -> cmd -> run`) and type in `git --version`.  
If you see `git version x.x`, you already have git.  

(Option 1 - easier but less flexible)  
1. Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
2. Go to `File -> Clone a Repository` and paste in this link:
`https://github.com/CornellDataScience/Deep-Learning-Course.git`

(Option 2 - slightly harder but more flexible)  
1. Download the latest [Git for Windows installer](https://gitforwindows.org/),
and follow the installation prompts.
2. Open a command prompt, and run `git clone https://github.com/CornellDataScience/Deep-Learning-Course.git`
to download all course material.



**Linux**: 
1. In the terminal, run `sudo apt-get install git` 
(you will be prompted for your password) 
2. Then run `git clone https://github.com/CornellDataScience/Deep-Learning-Course.git`


Alternatively, you may choose to download all materials in a zip
file by clicking the green "Clone or download" button in the upper
right corner and clicking "Download ZIP". However, this means
that you will have to download a new zip file every time course
material is updated!


## Installing TensorFlow

Open a terminal (**Mac/Linux**) or the Anaconda prompt
 (**Windows/Mac**)and type: 
```bash
pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow
```
If you have a GPU, use:
```bash
pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow-gpu 
``` 
To validate your installation, invoke python from your shell by typing:
```bash
python
```
Type the following short program line-by-line into your shell:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
sess = tf.Session()
print(sess.run(hello))
```
This should output:
```
Hello, TensorFlow!
```
