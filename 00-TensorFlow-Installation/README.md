# Installation Instructions

TensorFlow is a software library for Machine Learning developed by Google 
(created in 2015). Although it is primarily used in Python, APIs for C++, Java
(among others) also exist. It gets its name from the fact that a *tensor* is 
a multi-dimensional array (the *n*-dimensional generalization of a matrix)!  
  
If you have experience installing Python packages, simply follow the official
TensorFlow instructions [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).
