    "Notice that the value of the variable `x` changes with training, and converges to (nearly) the global minimum at $x=0$ as expected; it is not exact because gradient descent is an approximation.  The Session is still responsible for running the optimization operation, and a list of operations/tensors can be passed to the `session.run()` function to extract multiple values from the model. We don't need a feed_dict because there are no placeholders defined."
